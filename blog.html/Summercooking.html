    <b>Living as an internation student in Canada, I miss the food of my country every single day because
    its hard to get here.During summer I tried making Selroti which is one of the famous food of Nepal.
    We call it Nepali doughnuts.It is a rice-based sweet dish.It is usually made during festivals and served with pickel made up of potato and cucumber.

    <h3>Here is the recipe that I followed..</h3>
    <li>Step 1:Wash and soak the rice overnight. </li>

      <br><li> Step 2: drain the excess water from the rice. Take drained rice in a mixer jar and blend to a fine paste.</li> 
        
      <br><li>Step 3:Take the paste in a bowl and add sugar, ghee, rice flour and cardamom powder to it. </li> 
        
      <br><li>Step 4:Gradually add about 1-2 tablespoon water to it and whisk well till sugar dissolves completely. Batter should be of a thick consistency.</li> 
        
      <br><li>Step 5:Heat oil in a wide pan. Using a ladle, pour the batter in a circle shape into the hot oil.</li> 
        
      <br><li>Step 6:Reduce the flame to medium and let it cook on one side. Flip it to the other side using a tong. Fry till it gets light golden brown from both sides.</li> 
        
      <br><li>Step 7:Remove and drain on an absorbent paper. Store them in an air tight container once they cool down completely.</li> 
        
      <br><li>Step 8:Sel Roti can be served as a tea-time snack with tea/coffee or other beverages.</li>
