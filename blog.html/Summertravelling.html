    <br><b>Me and my friends went to lake view park during summer.The view was really pretty in the evening.
        We saw sunset which was looking like a painting of an artist. We saw ships for the first time.
        We played football in the park nearby. It was a pretty fun experience.
        I still have the pitures that we took there.
